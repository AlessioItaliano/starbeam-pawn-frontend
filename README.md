# About Website

My SRM (Sales and Relationship Management) system for a pawn shop helps manage customer interactions, track pawned items, streamline sales processes, and maintain comprehensive records. It enhances customer service by providing detailed customer history, automates communication, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements. The system also includes inventory management, transaction tracking, and reporting features, improving operational efficiency and aiding in decision-making for the pawn shop.
